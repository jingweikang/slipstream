Cycling data analysis and ingestion tooling for Strava performance data.

> **Note**: This project is being developed with significant contributions from Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant). Much of the codebase architecture, refactoring, and tooling setup has been collaboratively designed and implemented with AI assistance.

## Goal

Analyze cycling performance data to detect fatigue patterns and improve FTP (Functional Threshold Power) and pacing strategy.

## Current Status

**Phase 0: Authentication & Data Ingestion** ✅ Complete

Successfully ingested and stored historical Strava data:

```bash
$ poetry run python scripts/cli.py stats

ACTIVITY SUMMARY STATISTICS
============================================================

Total Activities: 1,126
Date Range: 2024-01-02T02:02:22Z to 2025-12-31T05:21:40Z

Total Distance: 15,404.3 km
Total Time: 965.6 hours
Total Elevation: 157,992.8 m

```

**Data stored:** 1,125 activities (90 MB) in Parquet format with full stream data (HR, power, cadence, GPS, altitude, etc.)

## Future Phases

- **Phase 1**: Data exploration and validation (DuckDB queries, summary statistics, data quality checks)
- **Phase 2**: Batch analysis with Spark to identify fatigue patterns and pacing strategies
- **Phase 3**: Real-time stream processing with Flink for live workout guidance
- **Phase 4**: Enhanced analytics with sleep, nutrition, and training load context

## Getting Started
